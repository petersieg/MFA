# some information on MFA MiniDOS format and tools

md-dir.c - show directory of 320k image argv(1) and optionally try to extract file arg(2)

test.img is such a 320kb floppy image file - one can use with Gotek+FlashFloppy.

Place file FF.CFG also on USB stick, to have FlashFloppy behave as required for MFA system!
