# Howto connect a PS/2 keyboard with the help of arduino

Just upload this simple sketch (UNO is enough) and connect a PS/2 adapter und wire the D1-D7+STB/STROBE and GND to the sub-d 15 connector.
Do NOT use the +5V from the MFA at this connector! It hasn't worked for me, but killed one Uno!

As always, use at your own risc. Carefully check connections before power it on.
